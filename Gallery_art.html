        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-110px; ">
          The Matter of Time allows the viewer to perceive the evolution of the artist's sculptural forms, from the relative simplicity of a double ellipse to the complexity of a spiral. The last two pieces of this sculpture are created from sections of toruses and spheres that produce different effects on the movement and perception of the viewer. These are unexpectedly transformed as the visitor walks through and around them, creating an unforgettable, dizzying feeling of space in motion. The entire room is part of the sculptural field. As he has done in other sculptures composed of many pieces, the artist has arranged the works deliberately in order to move the viewer through them and through the space surrounding them. The layout of the works along the gallery creates corridors with different, always unexpected proportions (wide, narrow, long, compressed, high, low). The installation also includes a progression in time. On the one hand, there is the chronological time that it takes to walk through and observe it from beginning to end. On the other, there is the time during which the viewer experiences the fragments of visual and physical memory, which are combined and re-experienced.

        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-935px;">
          Throughout his career the Chinese-born, New York-based artist Cai Guo-Qiang has drawn on a wide variety of symbols, narratives, traditions, and materials such as feng shui, Chinese medicine, and gunpowder. For the Deutsche Guggenheimís Cai Guo-Qiang: Head On, the artistís first solo exhibition in Germany, he develops a concept that reflects the diversity of his oeuvre and establishes a unique link to the city of Berlin. Head On is a gigantic installation in which 99 stuffed wolves rush headlong toward the galleryís eastern wall. Although the leader crashes into the wall, the pack still races after him. In a special performance prior to the showís opening, Guo-Qiang will create a related nine-by-four-meter drawing using various sorts of gunpowder. This image, titled Vortex, shows thousands of wolves rushing across the paper, creating a swirling organic form that exudes energy, strength, and fierce resolution. These two pieces are supplemented by the video Illusion II, which documents a spectacular firework performance to be produced prior to the opening.

        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-535px;">
          This comprehensive retrospective of Yves Klein's career encompasses his earliest monochrome paintings in red, pink, orange, yellow, green, white, and black; the famous blue monochromes, sponge reliefs, and sponge sculptures; the Anthropometries; the Monogolds; and his late experiments with the natural elements fire, air, and water. Klein's groundbreaking work, created over only about seven years, anticipated numerous tendencies including Happenings and performance, body art, land art, and aspects of Conceptual art. To this day it continues to exercise a lasting effect.

        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-115px; ">
          Almost 9 meters tall, Maman is one of the most ambitious of a series of sculptures by Bourgeois that take as their subject the spider, a motif that first appeared in several of the artist's drawings in the 1940s and came to assume a central place in her work during the 1990s. Intended as a tribute to her mother, who was a weaver, Bourgeois's spiders are highly contradictory as emblems of maternity: they suggest both protector and predator-the silk of a spider is used both to construct cocoons and to bind prey-and embody both strength and fragility. Such ambiguities are powerfully figured in the mammoth Maman, which hovers ominously on legs like Gothic arches that act at once as a cage and as a protective lair to a sac full of eggs perilously attached to her undercarriage. The spider provokes awe and fear, yet her massive height, improbably balanced on slender legs, conveys an almost poignant vulnerability.

      <div class="tooltip" style="float: right; padding-right: 13%"><p class="art_title">PUPPY <br> - Jeff Koons -</p>
        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-972px;">
          With Puppy, Koons engaged both past and present, employing sophisticated computer modeling to create a work that references the 18th-century formal European garden. A behemoth West Highland terrier carpeted in bedding plants, Puppy employs the most saccharine of iconography-flowers and puppies-in a monument to the sentimental. Imposing in scale, its size both tightly contained and seemingly out of control (it is both literally and figuratively still growing), and juxtaposing elite and mass-cultural references (topiary and dog breeding, Chia Pets and Hallmark greeting cards), the work may be read as an allegory of contemporary culture. Koons designed this public sculpture to relentlessly entice, to create optimism, and to instill, in his own words, "confidence and security." Dignified and stalwart as it stands guard at the museum, Puppy fills viewers with awe, and even joy.

        <span class="tooltiptext" style="margin-left:-545px;">
          Fujiko has been creating her foggy creations since the 1970s. Although not as popular in the U.S. as she is in other parts of the world, particularly Europe, Fujiko began making fog installations as a result of her interest in the concept of birth and death. At the start of her career, she mainly painted clouds but as artists and society, in general, started to get more aggressive in the 1960s, she switched from clouds to fog because she wanted a subject that could communicate the actuality of society while allowing audiences to interact with the environment.
